##### Question 2: Write a program that prompts the capacity in gallons of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallons the automobiles can be driven. The program outputs the number miles the automobile cam be driven without refueling.
So breaking down the problem that has been given into:

##### 1.1 Input:
- The capacity of your car fuel tank in gallons.
- The miles per gallon the automobile can achieve.

##### 1.2 Output:
- The total number of miles that the car can be driven without refueling 
 
##### 1.3 process:
-	Taking the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons and miles per gallon the automobile can achieve.
-	Total Miles=Fuel Tank Capacity in gallons ×Miles Per Gallon 
 -	Display the total miles so that a person can get ahead of what kilometer is left .

After this process to make this easy to code and compile let me write the pseudocode (false code)
##### 1.4 pseudocode:
- Step 1:Start 
- Step 2: Enter the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons you want to calculate the total miles left 
- Step 3:Enter the miles per gallon the automobile can achieve 
- Step 4: Total Miles=Fuel Tank Capacity in gallons ×Miles Per Gallon
- Step 5:Total Miles
- Step 6: stop
