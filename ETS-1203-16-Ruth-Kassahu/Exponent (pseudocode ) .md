Chapter two practical questions:
##### Question 2: Write a program that find the result of the expression xy where the value of X and Y are entered by the user.
 So breaking down the problem that has been given into:

##### 1.1 Input:
- Enter the base number that you want to calculate .
- Enter your exponent number.

##### 1.2 Output:
- The result of the xy.. 
##### 1.3 process:
-	Take the base number and multiply it until the number reaches the exponent by using iteration .

After this process to make this easy to code and compile let me write the pseudocode (false code)
##### 1.4 pseudocode:
- Step 1:Start 
- Step 2:Enter the base number that you want to calculate .
- Step 3: Enter the exponent number that you want to calculate .
- Step 4: Result =xy 
- Step 5:Display Result
- Step 6: stop
**I have choose to work this problem using for statement iteration
