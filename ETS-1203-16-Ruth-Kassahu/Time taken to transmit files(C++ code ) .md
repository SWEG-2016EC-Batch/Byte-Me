##### Question 6:  A serial transmission line can transmit 960 characters a second. Write a program that will calculate how long it will take to send a file, given the file size. Test your program on a 400MB (419,430,400 byte) file which may take days. So breaking down the problem that has been given into:

##### 1.1 Input:
- Enter the file size that you want to send 

##### 1.2 Output:
- The time that its going to take for you to transfer the file  .
##### 1.3 process:
-	Take the entered value (file size) then Multiply it to the time that its going to take to send 1 MB file .

After this process to make this easy to code and compile let me write the pseudocode (false code)
##### 1.4 pseudocode:
- Step 1:Start 
- Step 2 Enter the file size that you want to send(size).
- Step 3 Time for 1MB=1,048,576.
- Step 4: Total time =size*time for 1 MB.
- Step 5:Display Total time
- Step 6: stop
** to make the displaying a little understandable for people that is going to use it its going to be displayed in second ,minute ,hours
