**Problem analysis**

**Input:-** file size .

Initialize amount of file transfer in second.

**Output:-** calculate how long the file take to transfer.

**Operation:-**

Variable declaration – that holds an input and operational results

✓ Initializing file transmitted rate as 960 character per second

✓ Defining the pension as constant(5%)

✓ Print input prompt message and read corresponding input data

✓ Calculate transferring time , for that first find the following

Time in seconds=file size/60.

Time in minutes=time in second/60.

Time in hours=time in minutes/60.

Time in days=time in hour/24.

✓ Print output prompt message and process result ( time for transfering )

We use while loop to iterate the process.

**Pseudo code for BMI calculator**

**Step1:-** start.

**Step2:-** input base salary ,bonus rate,working hour,tax rate,pension rate

**Step3:-** calculate net salary=base salary +bonus -(pension+tax).

**Step4:-** prompt calculated net salary’

**Step5:-**Ask the user if they want to calculate another BMI.

**5.1** if yes,repeat the process from step2.

**5.2** if no ,end the process.
