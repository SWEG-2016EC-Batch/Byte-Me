- Question 2: Write a program that prompts the capacity in gallons of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallons the automobiles can be driven. The program outputs the number miles the automobile cam be driven without refueling.
So breaking down the problem that has been given into:

1,Input Variables:
- tankCapacity: The amount of fuel the tank can hold in gallons.
- milesPerGallon: Miles the automobile can be driven per gallon.

2,  Process:
- Multiply the tank's capacity by the miles the automobile can be driven per gallon to determine the total miles that can be driven without refueling.
- Total Miles=Fuel Tank Capacity in gallons ×Miles Per Gallon

3,Output:
Displays the total number of miles that the automobile can travel without needing a refill. 

 pseudocode:
- Step 1:Start
- Step 2:Enter the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons 
- Step 3:Enter the miles per gallon the automobile can achieve
- Step 4:Total Miles= Fuel Tank Capacity in gallons × Miles Per Gallon
- Step 5:Print total Miles
- Step 6: stop
