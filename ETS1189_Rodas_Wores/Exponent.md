- Question 2: Write a program that find the result of the expression xy where the value of X and Y are entered by the user.
- Lets break down the problem that has been given into:

1.1 Input:
- Enter the base number that you want to calculate .
- Enter your exponent number.
1.2 Output:
- The result of the x^y.( x to the power of y)
1.3 process:
- use the cmath pow to calculate x the power of y.
- After this process to make this easy to code and compile let me write the pseudocode (false code)

1.4 pseudocode:
- Step 1:Start
- Step 2:Please enter the base(x) of your choice:
- Step 3:Please enter the exponent(y) of your choice:
- Step 4:result = pow(x, y) //Calculate x raised to the power of y using the pow function
- Step 5:PRINT x, "raised to the power of", y, "is", result  // Display the result
- Step 6: stop // i have to chosen to do this problem using the cmath pow.
