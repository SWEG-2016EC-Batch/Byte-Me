Problem Analysis: File Transmission Time Calculation
The goal of this program is to calculate the time required to send a file based on its size and the transmission rate. The file size is provided by the user, and the transmission rate is fixed at 960 characters per second. The program should output the time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. 

Inputs:

The user needs to provide the size of the file (in bytes or characters).
The transmission rate is a constant value, which is 960 characters per second.
Logic:

The first step is to check if the user has input a valid file size (greater than 0). If not, an error message is displayed.
The total time to send the file is calculated by dividing the file size by the transmission rate (characters per second). If there is a remainder when dividing, we add an extra second to account for the fraction of time that would be needed.
The next step is to convert the total time in seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. This involves dividing the total time by the number of seconds in a day, then further breaking down the remaining time into hours, minutes, and seconds.

Outputs:

The program outputs the total time required to transmit the file, formatted in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Approach:

# Pseudocode for File Transmission Time Calculation

1. Start
2. Initialize constant TRANSMISSION_RATE = 960 (characters per second)
3. Prompt the user to enter the file size in characters (or bytes)
4. Read the file size (file_size)

5. If file_size <= 0
    - Print "File size must be a positive number."
    - Exit the program

6. Calculate the total time in seconds:
    - total_seconds = file_size / TRANSMISSION_RATE
    - If file_size is not divisible by TRANSMISSION_RATE (i.e. remainder exists)
        - Add 1 second to total_seconds

7. Convert total_seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds:
    - days = total_seconds / (24 * 3600)  (Total seconds in a day)
    - remaining_seconds = total_seconds % (24 * 3600)
    - hours = remaining_seconds / 3600  (Total seconds in an hour)
    - remaining_seconds = remaining_seconds % 3600
    - minutes = remaining_seconds / 60  (Total seconds in a minute)
    - seconds = remaining_seconds % 60

8. Print the result in the format: 
    - "Time to send the file: days days, hours hours, minutes minutes, seconds seconds."

9. End
